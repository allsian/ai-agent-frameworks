-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore CrewAI's agents with the following features:
- Reasoning capabilities for complex tasks
- Limiting reasoning attempts
- Error handling during reasoning

This demonstrates how CrewAI agents can perform sophisticated
reasoning tasks with transparent thought processes.
Configuration options:
- reasoning: Enable or disable reasoning capabilities
- max_reasoning_attempts: Limit the number of reasoning attempts to avoid infinite loops
